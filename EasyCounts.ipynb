Here $g$ is the identity on the image of $f$, and arbitrary elsewhere.  There are two ways of looking at this, first if $k$ is the size of the image of $f$ then there are $k!\\left\\{n\\atop k\\right\\}$ such functions $f$ and $n^{n-k}$ functions $g$ that are the identity on the image of $f$, so we have\n",

If there are $k$ points in the image of $f$ then there are $k!$ ways of assigning $f$ on the image of $f$, which then completely specifies $g$ on the image of $f$.  On the points outside the image of $f$ there are $k^{n-k}$ ways of assigning $f$ since it must map into its image.  Since $f$ permutes the elements of the image of $f$, we know that every point in the image of $f$  is mapped by $f$ from some point in the image of $f$, so we do not need to worry about only mapping to a subset.  Finally $g$ is completely arbitrary outside the image of $f$ so there are $n^{n-k}$ ways of assigning it.  So combining everything we have\n",
