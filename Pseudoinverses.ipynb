    "First let us count the number of pairs that satisfy the first condition $fgf=f$.  The condition only constrains $g$ on the image of $f$, so if $y=f(x)$ is in the image of $f$, then $f(g(y))=y$ and so $g(y)\\in f^{-1}(y)$ for all $y$ in the image of $f$.  In particular, $g$ is injective on the image of $f$.  Let $k$ be the cardinality of the image of $f$.  There are $n!/(n-k)!$ ways of specifying $g$ on the image of $f$, as we need to specify $k$ distinct ordered values out of $[n]$.  This in turn specifies $f$ on the $k$ values of $f$, as $f(g(y)) = y$.  There are $k$ choices for each of remaining $n-k$ values of $f$, and $n$ choices of the remining values of $g$.\n",

    "Counting the pairs of functions that satisfy both constraints takes only a slight modification of the above analysis.  For values $y$ in the image of $f$ we have that $f(g(y))=y$ so $g(f(g(y)))=g(y)$ so we only need to look at values outside the image of $f$.  Here if $g(x)=z$ we need $g(f(z))=z$.  This happens whenever $z = g(y)$ for some $y$ in the image of $f$.  As $g$ is injective on the image of $f$, there are $k$ choices for each value of $g(z)$ for $z$  not in the image of $f$.
